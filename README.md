## 🏗️ Steps to Build the Model

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Dataset: Network traffic data (e.g., CICIDS, UNSW-NB15, etc.).
- Handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Extracting key network parameters (e.g., packet size, protocol, IP addresses).
- Implementing feature selection techniques.

### 3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Model selection based on best performance.

### 4️⃣ Deployment
- Building a FastAPI-based API for real-time predictions.
- Serving model using **Docker & Kubernetes**.

### 5️⃣ Model Monitoring & Logging
- Logging predictions and tracking model drift.
- Implementing monitoring with **Prometheus & Grafana**.
